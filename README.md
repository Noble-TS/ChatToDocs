###  Planned Kapa AI Integration

We‚Äôve applied for the [Kapa Open Source Program](https://docs.kapa.ai/kapa-for-open-source) to enhance ChatToDocs.  
Once integrated, Kapa AI will power an interactive chat widget directly within the documentation site, allowing users to ask questions and receive instant, accurate answers sourced from project docs.
